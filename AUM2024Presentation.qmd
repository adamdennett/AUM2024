## Brief CASA/Arup Lab mission

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   Vision to develop and communicate to a wide audience a robust science around the applied urban modelling that the City Modelling Lab in Arup provides to clients across the UK and in other counties.
-   Where Arup's models and tooling are developed with, primarily, client-centred outcomes in mind, our academic motivation is to delve deeper and more critically into (initially) topics such as:
    -   the modelling/policy/decision making dynamics and interactions between client and consultant that lead to regional transport decisions being made.How and why are regional transport models used? Critical evaluation of what can and can't be achieved with them.
    -   equity considerations around the transition from fossil-fueled to electric private vehicles, incorporating a better, micro-level activity-based understanding of car dependency and the potential mitigating or exacerbating effects that new technologies like vehicle-to-grid charging may present.
    -   developing a deep understanding of the ways in which complex, agent-based behaviourally orientated transport models (such as MATSIMs) can be used to inform decisions around the provision of public transit - particularly buses - in transport systems. And to explore how artificial intelligence tools might be applied in developing generative solutions to various aspects of bus provision in different urban and regional settings.

## Four Seasons of SENZCAR

1.  **Equity** in transportation
2.  **Net Zero** in transport planning

## Project brief

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/abm1.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: r-fit-text
-   Project co-funded by Arup:

    the Transport East ABM

-   Not making a new model!

-   Instead looking at what innovative things

    we can do with one that **already exists...**

-   In relation to questions of socioeconomic

    inequalities and net zero

## Innovative contribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
\

***'Less methods looking for problems, rather the other way round'***

Alex Singleton, 2024

\

-   We need to consider what transport interaction models are built to do, and **why it is** that a given model is the best way of analysing a problem.

-   The value of 'person-based measures' (Geurs and Van Wee, 2011) and emergent behaviours (Crooks et al., 2019: p. 8)

-   Regional geography paradigm: linking Sub-National Transport Bodies and transport interventions from ABMs

-   In the context of a very tight funding environment
:::

## Research question

::: r-fit-text
How do the **simulated** **regional** transport planning interventions that

are likely to be the most persuasive in securing government funding,

and the most effective in suppressing unacceptable **inequities** between

individuals in transport, perform in relation to reaching **net zero**?
:::

## Research methodology

::: r-fit-text
-   **Literature** synthesis (regional geography, "equity", net zero, transport modelling)

-   **Interviews** with transport practitioners (public sector / consultancy)

-   **Clustering** from ABM output data, related to similar work on "DfT Personas"

-   Development of **equity indicators** based on various outputs from ABM scenarios\
:::

## Motivations: transport equity and decarbonisation

::: r-fit-text
1.  Climate crisis
\ 

    -   Climate emergency declared in 2019, must reach net zero by 2050
    -   In the UK, 26% of emissions in 2021 came from the transport sector (57% from private vehicle use)

2. Transport and connectivity
\ 

    -   Transport is a key driver for socio-economic improvement, social inclusion, and wellbeing

3. Current transport inequalities
\ 

    -   Poorest 10% of people receive around half the transport subsidy as the richest 10% (per household)
\ 

> How do we transition to a decarbonised transport system in the most equitable way?

:::

## Equity, vulnerability, and flexibility

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Equity can be seen as minimising transport vulnerability across the whole population

\

-   We can consider flexibility to be a form of capital, much like money or time

\

-   Vulnerability can be seen through the lens of flexibility capacity

 

-   Many facets of flexibility

## Car dependency

::: r-fit-text
-   Car dependency is a manifestation of low mode choice flexibility capacity

## Quantitative modelling of flexibility

::: r-fit-text
-   Lack of robust quantitative analysis of equity impacts in transport transition

 

-   Aim to inform which policies are most effective at delivering decarbonisation while maximizing equity

 

-   Use agent-based models to understand this with flexibility capability measured as a kind of utility score

 

-   Benefits over methods such as stated preference surveys
:::

# Flipping Modelling on its head

**Can AI be used to generate equitable policies while optimizing for Net-Zero?**

-   Rationale: Climate Change, Net Zero Targets, High Wealth Inequality

-   Many policies are conceived from a person then model, why not let the model develop the policy?

-   Equity and Net-Zero: Buses!

    -   Low-income population most likely to use and rely on buses.

## State of Buses

-   **Privatisation** - Crash in bus ridership and route availability.
-   **£2 fare** -- Introduced to increase ridership since COVID-19.
-   **Bus Franchising** -- Devolution of transport to combined authorities. :::

# Going Forward

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;"}
::: {style="width: 50%;"}
-   Implement lessons learnt into a calibrated Sheffield model.

-   Demand Responsive Transport -- Flexible transport options

-   Implementation of AI:

    -   Bus scheduling (Ai, G. et al. (2022))

    -   Express Bus Routes (Rodriguez J. et al. (2022))

    -   Network Changes

-   Equity Measures - Can we develop metrics outside of traditional transport metrics (Mode Share, Travel Time) to measure equity?

## Conclusions

-   Still in the early stages of our exploration in all of these topics, but all three PhD projects represent slightly different but complementary perspectives on the same broad challenge - decarbonising our transport system while keeping social considerations front-and-centre.

-   Always tempting to view any new innovation (regional ABMs for transport planning, transition to electric cars, generative AI for scheduling and routing) as potential silver bullets to challenging problems, but fully evaluating pros and cons needs time and space.

-   Consultancy world often ahead of academic world in developing quick/plausible solutions to challenges posed by clients. But narrow delivery focus rarely allows for deeper evaluation or experimentation that academics are afforded the time to explore.

-   CASA/Arup PhD projects hopefully go some way to bridging this gap - watch this space!
